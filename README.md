# SQLDemo

This is a basic Android mobile application that tracks the name, age, and active/inactive status of customers. Built using Java in Android Studio, a SQLLite local database tracks data entered into fields by the user, and this data is displayed on the screen upon pressing the "Add" button. Each customer is assigned a unique ID. 

Features: 
- Clicking on a customer in the list deletes that customer from the database and from the screen. 
- Typing text into the search bar displays customers entered in the database whose name and/or age contains the text.
